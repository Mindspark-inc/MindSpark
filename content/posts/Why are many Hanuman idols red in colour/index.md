How many times have you seen an idol of Hanuman and wondered why he is shown as red in color or in some places he is covered with Sindoor? ( Vermilion)

People will tell you, that red is the color of power strength, and so on. Or some philosophical or symbolic theory. So dull.

In the tales we hear as children, there is a much more interesting tale and it is all about Bhakti.

Ram was ruling Ayodhya and it was an idyllic time. Everyone was happy and Hanuman was especially happy. He was in Ayodhya serving his beloved Rama and Sita. He was far away from the intrigues and politics of Kishkindha. His heart was full and at peace. He was well-loved by Rama, Sita, Ram’s brothers, and everyone at Ayodhya.

They marvelled at the sight of the stalwart warrior Hanuman who seemed to be happy doing the smallest of service for Ram. Unlike others around the King, Hanuman was least interested in power or wealth.

Hanuman was welcome everywhere and he was always curious about the different aspects of life in the palace and Ayodhya. It was so different from life in the forest or even in Kishkindha.

One day Ram sent him to fetch Sita and Hanuman found Sita busy preparing food for Rama. There were many cooks in the palace but Sita always prepared something extra for Ram, it was an expression of her love for him.

Hanuman conveyed Ram’s message and Sita finished her work quickly to go to Rama. Before she went she washed her face and began to reapply the Sindoor on her forehead.

The ever-curious Hanuman observed this and asked her why she was so particular about the Sindoor. He knew Sita was a wise woman who did not do anything without reason. Sita smiled and explained that it was for protecting Rama and for his long life.

Hanuman pondered over this. The next day he appeared before Ram covered with Sindoor from head to toe! Everyone was shocked.

When Lakshman asked Hanuman why he had made himself look so strange and funny, people were laughing at him. Hanuman smiled and replied, “Why should I bother about people? Sita Ma told me that she wore Sindoor to protect Ram. I too want to protect Ram and pray for his long life. Sita Ma is divine and for her one small dot will do but I am just a vanar and so to ensure, I thought I better put Sindoor all over myself.

Since that day to honor Hanuman’s bhakti we pray to Hanuman and apply Sindoor to his idol so that we too develop a Bhakti as strong as Hanuman’s.

Namaste till the next time. 🙏
